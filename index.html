        About Me
 </h1> 
 <p>
        My name is Joy. I am currently a student in my third year of University. I enjoy spending time with my friends, reading novels,
        meeting new people and dancing. 
        I also really enjoy listening to music. It would be difficult to name my favorite genre of music
        but the closest pick at the moment would be House Music. 
        One exciting thing in my life right now, is that I am learning how to code from scratch.
        I hope I get better at it since it will be essential for my future career plans.
